## Aaj AI ke aane se bahut log confuse hain ki kaunsa programming language ya skill future mein demand mein rahega, aur kaunsa replace ho sakta hai.

Chaliye isko **4 parts** me divide karke simple aur clear tariqe se samajhte hain:

---

## 🔷 1. **Programming Languages – Future Demand vs AI Replacement**

| Language        | Future Demand | AI Replace Risk | Notes                                                          |
| --------------- | ------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Python**      | 🌟 Very High  | 🔻 Very Low     | AI/ML, Data Science, DevOps, Backend – Everywhere use hota hai |
| **JavaScript**  | ✅ High        | ⚠️ Medium       | Frontend & Full Stack; but basic JS can be generated by AI     |
| **TypeScript**  | ✅ High        | 🔻 Low          | Safer JS – used in big production frontend/backend             |
| **Java**        | ✅ Stable      | 🔻 Low          | Still widely used in enterprises, Android backend              |

| **Firebase / Supabase** | ⚡ Rising       | ⚠️ Medium       | Backend-as-a-service; AI can scaffold simple apps |
| **SQLite**              | ⚠️ Limited use | ⚠️ Medium       | Lightweight apps only                             |

> 🔹 **Database Admin (DBA) roles** automate ho rahe hain,
> 🔹 But **database modeling, optimization, query writing, replication setup** = human hi karega.
> 🔹 AI bas CRUD ya schema suggest kar sakta hai.
